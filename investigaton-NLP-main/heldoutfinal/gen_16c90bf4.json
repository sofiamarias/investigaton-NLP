  "question": "How much daily water intake did you recommend?",
  "predicted_answer": "The logs indicate that I recommended drinking a full glass of water at 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 3:00 PM each day. While I didn\u2019t specify a precise amount for each glass, it\u2019s implied that you should aim for a full glass (approximately 8 ounces or 240 ml) at each of those times."
