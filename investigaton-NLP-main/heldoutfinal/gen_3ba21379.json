  "question": "Am I currently budgeting for Max or Luna?",
  "predicted_answer": "Yes, you are currently budgeting for Luna. The logs show you've been tracking Luna's expenses, including food, litter, and supplies, and you've set aside $50 a month for her. You also recently purchased a new food bowl for Luna, which you are tracking. There is no mention of budgeting for Max."
