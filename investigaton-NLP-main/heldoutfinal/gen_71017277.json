  "question": "Which figure completed my Avengers action figure set?",
  "predicted_answer": "Black Widow. The user stated, \"I just got back from a flea market and scored a great deal on a mint condition \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album, and I also finally completed my set of Marvel Comic's \"The Avengers\" action figures last week, which is a huge relief after 6 months of searching for that last Black Widow figure.\""
